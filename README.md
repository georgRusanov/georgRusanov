## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Georgii.
Iâ€™m currently working in RingCentral as a SDET.

Iâ€™m passionate about QA automation and CI optimization. Currently, I work primarily with Java, but I also have experience with JavaScript, TypeScript, and C#. My expertise covers manual testing, test design, as well as test automation for both API and UI.

I actively apply modern tools and frameworks, combining strong architectural decisions, clean coding practices, and attention to detail. I enjoy contributing both as an individual engineer and as part of a team, with proven experience introducing new tools and improving workflows in enterprise environments.
